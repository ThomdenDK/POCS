1. Is the "final encoding" of the Weighted type relevant to the formalization in Isabelle?
Also, how can this type be used to construct, scale, bind and take the union of Weighted sets?
Should i try to prove the isomorphism with parametricity (and is it supported in Isabelle)?

2. Should I aim to have the same file structure?

3. What is the Equation and Solution stuff?

4. Where can i learn more type theory?
