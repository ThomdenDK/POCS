1. At page 8, they define a transitive closure with the semiring, but the function they define to compute
the closure is recursive without making the problem easier. How does it compute anything?

2. Also it uses the connect operator. Our representation of a weighted set is a function from an element
to a weight. That means we can't iterate/enumerate the elements.
How are we supposed to implement the connect operator in a computable way (without predicates)?
Also, is the connect operator even defined if the set can be infinite?
a ->x
	b1->1----V
	b2->0.5--> c
	b3->0.25-A
	...
Then what is g >=> g? There does not exist a minimum here.

Also if we use a regular set instead of a function

3. The paper sometimes writes a set which has multiple of the same element with different weights and they
just quotient it to be one element with minimum weight. Should ours do the same (support duplicates)?
