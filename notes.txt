"Weighted" represents FINITE weighted sets and makes graphs of FINITE breadth
If (1, a) is in Weighted, is (2, a) also, given the quotient?
Predicates might be acceptable as they are used to define ordering by saying "there exists"

Since sets do not support folding, it is hard to filter and do any kind of operation on them.

In order to support connect, the set has to be mappable

I cannot implement Monad or Semiring for a type synonym. So cannot implement Weight semimodule on Weighted
